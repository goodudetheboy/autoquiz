The internet is huge
#Devices connected to it is equally crazy
Desktops, laptops, servers, router, switches, tablets, cellphones, atms, industrial equipment, cars, dildo too probably

Physical layers are not really how it works when things connect to the internet

WANS, wireless, cellular networking

Dial-up and Modems
In the old days, before the Ethernet invention
Computer networks are invented to connect devices in closed physical proximity
Duke wants to share info far away
They realize they can use public telephone network

PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)
AKA POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
Not entirely interchangeable
POTS is traditional analog voice comm service
PSTN is global system of interconnected telephone network, both analog and digital

Usenet
Precursor to dialup connection today

Dial-up connection
Uses POTS for data transfer
Connection is established by dialling phone number


Transferring across dial-up uses Modem
Modulator-demodulator
Take data that computer understand turns into wavelength then transmits through phone line
Kinda like how lines turns into electrical charge
These have very low Baud rates
Measurement of how many bits can be passed across phone line in a second
1950s, 110 bits/second
Usenet, 300 bits/second
More popular, 14.4 Kb/second
Might be useful for rural places

Broadband
In internet connectivity, means any types of connectivity not dial-up technology
Much faster than the faster dial-up connections
Refers to connections that are always on
Long-lasting connection that don’t need to be established

Broadband brings the popularization of internet
Dial-up connection will be saturated by a few users

Big businesses use T-carrier technologies to do internet
Made by AT&T to transmit multiple phone calls over single link
Much faster than dial-up

Need data transfer rates faster
Back then, it takes 19.4 minute for a 2MB photos with a Baud rates of 14.4 Kb/s

T-carrier Technologies
T1 specification can takes 24 phone calls through a single twisted pair of copper cable
This tech is repurposed for data transfer, can do 1.55 megabits per second

T1
Originally used to connect different telecom company sites to each other and other telecom company
Then, T1 lines are used to do faster internet connectivity

T3
28 T1s all multiplexed
1.544 x 28 = 44.736 Mbps

T-carrier is still being used

Digital Subscriber lines
Internet is getting more popular
Companies: how to get more bucks?
Maybe use same infrastructure but differently?
Research showed TP copper used by modern telephone
Can be used to transmit way more data
By operating in frequency different from normal phone calls, DSL
Can be used to much more data faster than dial-up
Allow for voice and data transfer to occur at the same time
Use DSLAM
Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers
Connect through phone lines
Long-running, connected when turned on until turned off

DSLAM types
ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
Different speeds for outcoming and incoming data
Faster download and slower upload
Home user are usually just clients, so just ask to download stuff
Outbound data is usually smaller than inbound data
Similar user experience, but lower cost
SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
Same as ADSL, but same download and upload speed
Used for businesses for their website server
Now, cheaper cost of operations lead to SDSL be common for both household and business
1.544 Mbps ~= T1
HDSL (High-bit-rate Digital Subscriber Lines)
Speeds above 1.544 Mbps
There are other too with different bandwidth options

Cable Broadband

TV
Originally, TV broadcast is wireless sent out by giant TV tower
Must be near giant TV tower to get TV
Cable TV is soon developed
Used for rural areas
Continue to expand slowly
1984, CCPA Act past
Deregulated cable => huge boom in cable television
As big as telephone 
Cable companies notice coaxial cables can be used to transfer much more data than needed for TV viewing
Use different frequency for TV broadcast, can deliver high speed internet access
Basis for cable broadband

Cable broadband
Main difference cable internet access and other internet delivery
Shared bandwidth technologies
Connection from home goes to central office (CO)
Old days, COs office staffed with telephones operator
Connecting CO can guarantee constant connection
Shared bandwidth model share certain bandwidth until ISPs core network
Now, shared bandwidth it’s not noticeable thanks to development
Managed by Cable Modem
Sits at the edge of consumer’s networks, and connects to cable modem termination system (CMTS)
This connects to Core ISP network


Fiber Connections
Fiber is used a lot in the internet
Aboslute maximum distance for electrical signal of copper is thousands of feet
Fiber? Many miles
Now, fiber is used a lot to deliver data

FTTX (Fiber To The X)
Deliver data using fiber
FTTN (Fiber To The Neighborhood)
Fiber tech used to deliver data to a single cabinet that serves a population
Then use copper for the rest
FTTB (Fiber To The Business/Building/Basement)
Fiber used to deliver data to physical individual buildings
Data delivery to an individual building
Then use copper for those inside
FTTH (Fiber To The Home)
Fiber used to delivery to house/neighborhood
FTTH and FTTP == FTTP (Fiber To The Premises)

ONT (Optical Network Terminator)
Converts data from protocols the fiber network understand to those for twisted pair copper
Instead of using a modem

Broadband Protocols
Broadband needs set of instructions, rules, and communication to various network layer protocol
Two types:
PPP (Point to Point Protocol)
PPPoE (Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet)

PPP
Byte-oriented protocol used for high-traffic data transmissions
Data-link layer
Configuration:
Multilink connection for spreading traffic multiple PPP connections
Compressions increases throughput by reducing amount of data in frame
Authentication for exchange authentication messages, with two methods
PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) hard to obtain plaintext if passwords are compromised
CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) three-way handshake auth that periodically confirms identity of clients
Error detection includes FCS (Frame Check Sequence) and looped link detection
FCS is a number included in frame calculated over Address, Control, Protocol, Information, and Padding fields
Used for checking data loss
Looped link detection detects looped link using magic numbers
Magic number is generated randomly at each end of connection, so when looped message is received, device checks the magic number against its own
If line is looped, number will match sender’s magic number, frame is then discarded

PPP’s sub-protocols
NCP (Network Control Protocol)
Used to negotiate optional config parameters and facilities for network layer
There is one for each higher layer used by PPP
LCP (Link Control Protocol)
Initiates and terminates connection automatically for hosts
Automatically configures interfaces at each end like magic numbers and selecting for optional authentication

PPP Frame

Flag 
Single byte
Lets receive know beginning of frame
Address
Single byte
Contains broadcast address
Control
Single byte
Required for various purposes but allows connection data link
Protocol
Varies from one to three bytes
Identify network protocol of datagram
Data
Information
1500 bytes limit
FCS
2 or 4 bytes
Verify data integrity

Encapsulation
One data is in frame, it is then encapsulated
Process where each layer takes data from previous layer and adds headers and trailers for next layers

These frames are sent and then de-encapsulated

PPP property
Expensive
Hard to manage due to direct cables and links
You shoul duse multi-access Ethernet solution
Comes PPPoE

PPPoE
Ways to encapsulate PPP frames inside ethernet frame
Tunnel packets over DSL connection server povider’s IP network
PPPoE has
Authentication
Encryption
Compression
Uses PAP for authentication
Use case:
DSL server where PPPoE modem-router connects to DSL service
PPPoE DSL modem is connected to a PPPoE-only router using Ethernet cable
PPPoE however needs a new step because ethernet connections are multi-access
Requires what’s called a discovery stage
This stage establishes session ID to identify hardware address
Ensures data gets routed to the correct place


Wide Area Network Technologies
Imagine you are in charge of a network for a business
You have few employees
You setup a router to workstation
You set up router to have a DHCP and a DNS server to manage networking
Salespeople need to connect network data
You set up a VPN server, accessible via port forwarding

CEO decides to open a new office
Now you have an entire second offices that need access to local network
This is where WAN comes in

WAN (Wide Area Networks)
Acts like single network, but spans across multiple physical locations
Unlike LAN
Require you to contract a link with the ISP across the internet
ISP handles data delivery from one site to another
Just like all computers in one physical location

Two HQs
Each’s network has a demarcation point
The distance between two demarcation point is where ISP takes over
Area between each demarcation point and ISP’s core network is called a local loop
Maybe a T-carrier line or Fiber optic
Connects to ISP’s local network and then core network and then the Internet

WAN
Often at work instead of the Ethernet

Physical versus software-based WANs
WAN Router:
Used as an intermediate systems to route data amongst LAN member groups of a WAN (aka WAN endpoints)
Use private connection
AKA border routers or edge routers
Help facilitate org’s access to a carrier network
Have a digital modem interface for WAN, which works at OSI link layer, and an ethernet interface for the LAN
SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN):
What happen when you need cloud-based WAN environments?
Simplify implementation of cloud-based WAN
Cost isi much less when operate a cloud-based SD-WAN than buying a traditional WAN
Replace needs for expensive lines leased from ISP by linking regional LANs together to build a WAN

WAN Optimization
How to optimize network traffic?
Compression
Reduce file sizes for network traffic efficiency
Many compression algos for text, image, videos
Requires both sides to have same compress/decompress algo
Deduplication
Prevents files stored multiple time within network
One copy is kept in central location
All “copies” are just file pointers to that one copy
Pros:
Saves hard drive
Data backups are easier
Reduces disaster recovery
Protocol Optimization
Improves efficiency of networking protocol for apps that needs higher bandwidth and low latency
Local Caching
Store local copies of network and internet files on users’ computer to reduce need to resend info
It’s caching bro
Some products can even cache shared files at one physical LAN location if employees tend to request same sets of file frequently
Traffic Shaping
Optimize network performance by controlling flow of network traffic
Three techniques
Bandwidth throttling: control network traffic volume during peak time
Rate limiting: cap max data rates/speeds
Magic algorithms: classifying and prioritizing data to given pref to more important traffic

WAN Protocols
Packet switching
Data transmission method
Messages broken into multiple packets
Each packet contains header with info on how to put together and destination
Kinda like lego instruction
What about data corruption?
Packets are triplicated
Sent separately over optimal routes through internet
Copies are compared to each other to see if any data corruption and if possible correct each other
If cannot be reassembled/corrected, will have to resend the packet
Frame relay
Also data transmission method
Older tech
Used on ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) lines
Now used in other network interfaces
Used to transmit data between endpoints of a WAN through packet switching that works at data link and physical layers
Frame Relay Networks are used, which also contains routing address information for destination
PVCs (Permanent Virtual Circuits) for long-term data connections
SVCs (Switched Virtual Circuits) for temporary session
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
Data encoding method
Use asynchronous time-division multiplexing
Encoded data packaged into small, fixed-size cells
Then can send the cells over long distance
Uses routers as endpoints between ATM and others
Has been replaced by IP tech
HLDC (High Level Data Control)
Encapsulation or data link protocol to delivery data frame through networks
Include fields
Stard end flags
Controls
FCS,
Protocol used
Developd to use multiple protocols to replace SLDC
Features:
Error correction
Flow control
Data transmission through polling
Has three modes:
NRM (Normal Reponse Mode) - primary node must give permissions to secondary nodes to transmit
ARM (Asynchronous Response Mode) - allows secondary node to initiate communication
ABM (Asynchronous Balanced Mode) - both act as either primary or secondary nodes
Can initiate communications without permission
Packet over SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) or SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)
Communication protocol used for WAN transport
Define how P2P links communicate over fiber optics cables
MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
Network routing optimization methods
Replace table lookups for long network addresses with short path labels
These label direct data from node to node

Point-to-Point VPNs
Alternative to WAN
WAN is good for large amount data transfer
Companies have been moving more internal services to the Cloud

Cloud
Let companies outsource internals to other companies to handle
Ex: email
Previously, have to host mail server
Now, you can host in on another mail server
Pay another company to handle everything about email service
Businesses now no longer highspeed connections between sites
So no need higher cost of WAN
Now only need Point-to-Point VPNs

P2P VPNs
Different sites can still communicate 
AKA site-to-site VPNs
Sets up VPN tunnels between two sites
Operates like a traditional VPN setup 
Tunneling logic is setup at either sites

Wireless Networking Technologies
Network without wires (duh)
Difference between infra networks and adhoc network
How wireless channels help wireless networks work
IEEE 802.11 standards (family)
Make up what we called WiFI

WiFi
Wireless networking works through radio waves
Different 802.11 standards use same protocol, but operate different frequency bands
Certain section of radio spectrum that’s been agreed upon to be used for certain communications
In NA, FM radio operates between 88 and 108 MHz
AKA FM broadcast bands
WiFi use different frequency bands
2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz
Most common specifications
802.11b, a, g, h, ac
In order of they were adopted
Each newer version has seen some improvement
Hihgher access speed
More devices can use

802.11 protocols
Physical and data-link layers
802.11 frame
802.11 Frame

Frame control field
16 bits long
Contains number of subfields used to describe how the frame is to be processed
Duration field
How long the total frame is so receives knows how long to listen
4 address fields
Instead of 2 (interesting)
Background:
Most common setup are devices called WAP (wireless access points)
Device that bridges wireless and wired portions of a network
Single wireless network covers a large area
Can have a lot of WAPs
A device will associate with a certain WAP
One that physically closest to
But can determine by a bunch of things like general signal strength or wireless interference
Associations is very important
Allows for incoming transmissions to WAP to be sent to the right access point
Thus breeds the needs to be room which wireless access point to be processing the frame
That’s why 4 address fields are needed
Address 1 - Source address field
MAC of sending device
Address 2 - Intended destination
MAC of receiving device
Address 3 - Receiving address
MAC of WAP that should receive the frame
Address 4 - Transmitter Address
MAC of WAP that just transmitted the frame
Usually, destination and receive address might be same
Also with source and transmitter
But depends on architecture
Sometimes WAP will relay frames to one another
All addresses in 802.11 frames are MAC, each of these fields are six bytes
Sequence control
Between address 3 and 4
16 bits long
Sequence number to keep track of frame orders
Data payload
The content of the payload
FCS field
Checksum for CRC checks
WiFi 6

Assigned dynamically by WAP to separate devices
Transmit beamforming
Used to send signals that allow for more efficient higher data rates by targeting each connected devices

Wi-Fi 6E extends 6 into 6 GHz
Adds a 6GHz band with all the features of WiFi 6
6E has more channels to use to bradcast
14 more 80MHz channels and seven more 160MHz channels
More channels, better performance even when under heavy loads


Alphabet Soup

Wifi Standards
802.11: a, b, g, n, ac, ad, af, ah, ax, ay, and az
What’s the difference between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz?

2.4 vs 5GHz
Many techs uses microwave bands
WiFI, ZWave, ZigBee, Thread, Bluetooth, and NFC
WiFI uses 2.4 and 5 GHz microwave
WiFi can select between these two waves to load-balancing network traffic also

2.4 GHz
Pros:
Longest signal range from 150 feet (45m) indoors to 300 ft (92m) outdoors
Can pass through walls and other solid objects
Cons:
Can be intercepted by cybercriminals
Limited number of channels
Only have 11 to 14 channels, depending on regulations

Does not penetrate walls and solid objects as well as 2.4

IEEE 802.11 standards
History:
First standard in 1997 for wireless fidelity
For computer device manufacturers to use as common protocol for wireless communications
Amended 802.11 specs multiple times as well as enhancements
Add one or two letters appended to 802.11
Property
Majority of wireless networks use IEEE 802.11
Client includes laptops, tablets, smartphones, IoT devices configured to connect to WAP
This configuration is called “infrastructure mode”
WAP can serve both wireless and wired networks
For wired, WAP works as a bridge between wireless device and wired networks
WAP connects to Ethernet switch through a wired Ethernet cable

IoT Data Transfer protocol
Two common ones
Request/Response model:
Used in distributed system where communication flow between servers and clients
Requests and response for data
Example: HTTP, CoAP
Publish/Subscribe
Communications between publishers (host) and subscribers (clietns)
Messages routed through a borker
Subs can sign p to channel to receive notices through broken when pub have new messages
Example: MQTT, AMQP

IoT data protocols at application layer
IOT devices
Collect environmental data, equipment data, metered dat
Needed to transfer and format data for use by applications that interface with human or automated systems
Some protocols:
HTTP/S
Most widely used
Uses ASCII formatting
Header size of 8 bytes
Designed for transmitting documents
Uses TCP or UDP for sending info
Request/Response model
M2M (Machine-to-Machine) Communication Protocols
Direct communication for low power devices, machines, and systems
Primary architectural and protocol groups in M2M electronic
Three groups:
Representational State Transfer (REST): for web accessible systems
Service-oriented Architectures (SOA): for industrial automation systems
Message Oriented Protocol: For async data transfers for distributed systems
MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)
IoT data-centric protocol for M2M
Pub/sub model
Supports Quality of Service
TCP for sending info
SSL and TLS for security
Uses binary format and 2-byte header
CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
For IoT constrained nodes and networks designed for M2M applications
Very similar to HTTP
Based on REST model
Place resources on a server that is accessible to clients via URL
AMQP (Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
For messages amongst applications in different organization/platforms
Remove vendor lock-in for app comm
Reliable and secure
XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
Decentralized, open standard for chat, messaging, video and voice, collab tools
Built on Jabber
Data Distribution Service (DDS)
API standard and middleware protocol from OMG (Object Management Group)
Exists in application layer, between software and operating system
Pub/sub model
Data-centric, low latency data connectivity
Helps devices in IoT ecosystems share data more efficiently



Wireless Network Configurations
Ad-hoc networks
Node speak directly to each other
WLANS (Wireless LANS)
Access points as a bridge between devices
Mesh networks
Hybrid of two

Ad-hoc networks
Simplest of three
No supporting network infra
Communicates within range
All nodes help pass along messages
Not the most common
Smartphones can ad-hoc network with others in the area
Used in industrial where equipments to connect with each other
Powerful tool during disaster
Pro can use ad-hoc network when doing search-and-rescue

WLANS
Bridges between wired and wireless networks
Wired just like a normal LAN
Wired contains outbound internet link
To access outside of WLAN
Wireless connects to AP
Then forward traffic along to gateway router

Mesh networks
Like ad-hoc
Lots of devices communicate wirelessly
Form a mesh like links between nodes
Most mesh are only WAP
Still be connected to wired networks
Can increase performance and range of wireless networks

Wireless Channels
Individual smaller sections of overall frequency band used by wireless networks
Very important
Reduce collision domains
Has been most reduced in wired networks through switches
There are no such things as a “wireless switch”
Channels help this (somewhat)
2.4GHz and 5GHz are shorthands for where these wireless bands begin
2.4: 2.4GHz-2.5GHz
Example: 802.11B
Channel 1 operates 2412 MHz
Channel width in 22MHz
So frequencies actually between 2401 and 2423
Because radio waves are imprecise
Need buffer
Some channels overlap
With channel width 22MHz
Channel 1 midpoint at 2412MHz is completely isolated from Channel 6 @ 2437 MHz and Channel 11 @ 2459MHz
Now, wireless networking can auto sense which channels are most congested
Remember, there are many 802.11 specs
Goal is reduce collision domain

Wireless Security
With wired, only devices knows what being transmitted are two nodes at the end of the link
Not with wireless
Some close can listen in on what is being passed around

Introduce WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
Encryption tech that provides very low level privacy
Protects just a little
Really weak encryption algorithm
Bad actors can easily break through this
Only uses 40 bits for encryption key
Can be cracked in just few minutes

WEP is replaced with WPA (WiFI Protected Access)
Default encryption key is 128-bit
Uses WPA-2 now
256-bit key

Can use MAC filtering
Allow for connections from a set of specific set of MAC addresses belonging to device you trust
Doesn’t encrypt, but to prevent authorized devices from connecting to the network


WPA3
Built upon WPA2 and intended to replace WPA2
New benefits:
Simplified wireless security
Stronger auth
Powerful encryption
Stable business continuity
Enhanced security methods
Replacement for legacy protocols
Protected Management Frames (PMF)
Two version: personal and enterprise

WPA-3 Personal
Intended for users and personal/home WiFi networks
Natural password selection:
Users can use passwords easier to remember
Increased ease of use
No need to change the way to connect WiFi to benefit from WPA3
Forward secrecy:
If password is stolen, WPA3 can continue to protect data being transmitted
SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)
Improves on WPA2-Personal PSK (Pre-shared Key) handshake
Uses PSK to generate Pairwise Master Key (PMK)
PMK uses password-based authentication and is shared between WAP and wireless
Uses complex, multi-stage process for proving that they each possess PMK
Very hard for bad actors to intercept packets to extract identifiable auth keys
If SAE transaction successful, wireless device will pass auth stage and gain access

WPA3-Enterprise
For business networks with multiple users
GCMP-256 (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol):
GCMP-256 replaces WPA2 1280-bit CCMP (AES-Counter Mode Protocol) CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code)
Provides data integrity and confidentiality
Takes more computing power to crack
OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption):
Improves WPA2 802.1x EAP (Open Authentication and Extensible Authentication Protocol)
In WPA2, EAP required additional support to help encrypt and authentication login
In WPA3, OWE replaces EAP with a solution that encrypts and authenticates all wireless traffic
Replaces WiFI passwords by assigning unique key to each device that has permission to access network
Repairs a weakness in WiFi uses experience in open networks
DPP (Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol)
DPP uses QR codes or NFC tags to grant passwordless WiFi access to wireless devices
384-bit HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) with SHA:
HMAC creates hash from secret key
Hash is sent with each message between WAP and user’s device
Hash code from origin of message is compared to hash code from receive to determine if hash codes match
ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Exchange) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
Key management and authentication uses ECDHE protocol and ECDSA encryption for faster performance
Protocol used by most browsers
Replaces WPA2 4-way handshake

Cellular Networking
AKA mobile networking
Common all over the world
Very similar to 802.11
Also lots of different specifciatios for cellular
Works over radio frequency
Different from wifi is that it can go very long distances more easily

Makeup
Built around cells
Each is assigned a specific band
Use bands that don’t overlap
Neighboring cells make up WLAN with multiple access points
Each access point just have much larger ranger

Mobile Device Networks
Use wireless networks to communicate with internets
Cell, WiFi, Bluetooth, IoT protocols

If a device is not connecting to a wireless network
Check if it has been turned on
Airplane mode

A mobile device can have multiple modes at the same time
Will try to connect with the most reliable and least expensive connections

Metered connections
Cell phone plan
Mobile devices will try to use non-metered connections

Unreliable network connections

Wireless Network Protocols for IoT
IoT devices can use both wired and wireless methods to connect to Internet
Most IoT devices uses the following:
WiFi
IEEE 802.15.4
Cheap, efficient wireless access tech used for IoT devices that run on battery power
Uses 2.4GHz or lower radio band frequqncies
ZigBee:
LR-WPAN intended for smart home use
Can be accessed through WiFi or Bluetooth
Thread:
Low-latency wireless mesh networking protocol based on IPv6
Make thread networks compatible with many IoT eco systems
Z-Wave:
Interoperator, wireless mesh protocol
Based on low-powered RF (radio frequency) comms
Wireless Mesh Network
Mesh networks are used by popular wireless IoT like Zigbee or Z-wave
Use less power
Decentralized network of connected devices
Full mesh: Every node can comm with all other nodes in network
Partial mesh: nodes can only comm with nearby nodes
Bluetooth:
Operates at 2.45 GHz frequency bad
3Mbps connections
Range: 100 ft (30.6 meters))
Good choice for creating a short distance wireless connection
NFC
Short-range, low data, wireless communication protcol
13.56 MHz
LoRaWan (Long Range Wide Area Network)
Open source networking protocol designed to connect battery powered, wireless IoT devices to the internet
